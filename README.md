# DectICO
An alignment-free supervised metagenomic classification method based on feature extraction and dynamic selection

============
Introduction
============

DectICO is an alignment-free supervised metagenomic sample classification algorithm. It selects the ICO dynamically and classifies the metagenomic samples based on the refined ICO vectors with SVM.

====================
Software Requirement
====================

We require a Windows or linux system with the Matlab and Perl software. Matlab (R2013a 64-bit) and Perl (v5.16.3 64-bit) were used in our experiments.
